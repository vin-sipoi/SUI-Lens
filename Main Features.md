# SUI Community Lens – Blockchain Community Visualizer

Welcome to the SUI Community Lens project – a playful, interactive, and gamified Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to offer a unique window into the SUI blockchain community. Our mission is to visualize community activity using dynamic, interactive UI that  open to reveal real-time metrics, social feeds, and engaging gamification features. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and integrated with the SUI blockchain, this project is meant to be both informative and fun!

## Technical Requirements Document

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

- **Community Details Panel:**
  - **Dropdown/Modal Design:** The burst reveals a panel that contains:
    - **Social Links:** Direct access to Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and more.
    - **Key Metrics:** Active users, transaction volume, sentiment analysis, etc.
    - **Latest Activity:** A snapshot of recent community activity pulled from the SUI blockchain.

- **Basic Analytics & Click Tracking:**
  - Record every bubble interaction to monitor which communities receive the most attention.
  - Integrate with backend services like Firebase or Redis to maintain real-time leaderboards and analytics.

- **Advanced Gamification:**
  - **Achievements & Rewards:** Users earn badges (like an “Explorer Badge”) and “pop points” for engaging with community bubbles.
  - **Leaderboards:** Gamify community engagement by ranking communities based on clicks and interactions.
  - **Enhanced Visuals:** Add bubble glow animations and subtle sound/haptic feedback to celebrate top-performing communities.

- **User Profiles & Wallet Integration:**
  - Implement WalletConnect for SUI wallet authentication, enabling users to personalize their experience (for example, filtering to show “Your Communities”).
  - Allow community upvotes and downvotes, possibly using smart contracts for a decentralized approach.

- **Social Media & Live Feeds:**
  - Integrate live feeds from Twitter/X, Discord, and Telegram to provide real-time community insights.
  - Show live sentiment analysis and updates to keep users informed about current trends.

- **SUI Blockchain Data Integration:**
  - Pull real-time data from SUI RPC nodes using the official SUI SDK.
  - Display on-chain metrics such as transaction volumes, smart contract usage, and other blockchain-specific data.

- **Community-Driven Content:**
  - Allow community members to submit new communities through SUI smart contracts.
  - Introduce an upvote/downvote system to maintain high-quality community entries.

- **Notifications & Data Export:**
  - Enable push notifications for key community milestones and updates.
  - Offer the ability to export community metrics in CSV or JSON format for deeper analysis.

## Technical Specifications Sheet

### Frontend Components & Stack

- **Framework & Libraries:**
  - **Next.js 14:** For server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** For modern, responsive styling.
  - **D3.js:** For crafting a dynamic, force-directed bubble chart.
  - **Framer Motion/GSAP:** For smooth, interactive burst animations.
  - **React & Context API:** For efficient state management across components.

- **Key Components:**
  | Component          | Description                                                                 |
  |--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | `Mdodern UI`      |

### Backend & API Integrations

- **API Endpoints:**
  | Endpoint                     | Description                                               |
  |------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
  | `/api/communities`           | Fetches all communities (with caching via Redis).         |
  | `/api/communities/[id]`      | Retrieves detailed metrics for a specific community.      |
  | `/api/analytics`             | Logs user interactions and updates community leaderboards. |

- **Backend Stack:**
  - **Next.js API Routes:** For backend logic and serving API endpoints.
  - **Node.js/Express (or Serverless):** For additional backend functionalities.
  - **Redis & Firebase:** For caching and real-time analytics.
  - **Database:** MongoDB or SQL for storing community data and user interactions.

- **Blockchain Integration:**
  - **SUI SDK & RPC Nodes:** For secure access to blockchain data.
  - **WalletConnect:** For wallet authentication and secure transaction signing.
  - **Smart Contracts:** For decentralized community submissions and on-chain voting.
