# Fix "No account connected" Error Plan

## Problem Analysis
The error occurs in useSponsoredTransaction.ts when currentAccount is null, even when the user is authenticated via UserContext. This indicates a disconnect between user authentication state and wallet connection state.

## Steps to Fix

1. [x] Investigate the relationship between UserContext authentication and Mysten dApp Kit wallet connection
2. [x] Update useSponsoredTransaction.ts to handle the case where user is authenticated but wallet is not connected
3. [x] Add proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms
4. [x] Update create/page.tsx to handle the error gracefully
5. [x] Test the changes to ensure proper flow

## Current Understanding
- User authentication is handled via UserContext (Google auth, JWT)
- Wallet connection is handled via Mysten dApp Kit's useCurrentAccount
- These two systems may not be perfectly synchronized

## Implementation Completed
1. Updated useSponsoredTransaction.ts to handle null currentAccount gracefully
2. Added toast notifications for user feedback
3. Changed from throwing errors to returning null and showing user-friendly messages
4. Added session validation using getSession from enoki-flow
5. Updated create/page.tsx to handle null return value from sponsorAndExecute

## Additional Changes Made
- Imported getSession from '@/lib/enoki-flow' to validate zkLogin sessions
- Added session check before transaction execution to ensure user is properly authenticated
- Enhanced error handling to provide better user feedback

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure that:
- Users receive appropriate feedback when their wallet is not connected
- The application does not crash when transactions cannot be executed
- Session validation works correctly with zkLogin authentication
